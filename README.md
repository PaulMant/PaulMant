Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Paul Mantello, an independent engineer and software developer with 10 years of experience.

I started with C++ and Java development and quickly specialized in the web, beginning with PHP.

Subsequently, I became a Technical Lead for Angular and Node.js and then a Lead Developer. These experiences have allowed me to gain expertise in web development, particularly in JavaScript/TypeScript.
