Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with an engineering degree in computer science in 2014 from ISEN Toulon. 
I have been working for 10 years with various major companies in the PACA region and around the world. 
I specialize in web development and act as a technical lead/Tech Lead on Angular, Node.js, and PHP. I have been a freelance engineer for 2 years and also work as a CTO in startups, helping them regain control over the technical side of their projects.
